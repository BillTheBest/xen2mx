* matching
* early

* open any_nic any_endpoint

* add details to omx_cmd_bench

* request alloc/free helpers to memset them

* likely/unlikely in the lib; for gcc only

* check pingpong contents
* factorize loopback_test send functions once unexpected medium are ready
* check loopback data instead of displaying

* make connect idempotent and drop workaround in pingpong
* send a nack on bad session, except for connect (no session), truc or nack libs

* true pull support
  - events on both sides
  - multiple frames per pull
  - multiple pull per request
  - actual data transfer with user region locking
* support eventq full by queueing things?
  - upto when? reserve before sending? should be guaranteed by the lib (polls before sending) => no need to queue?
  - use it for shared memory ?
* rdma_get
* rdma_put

* true sleeping in the kernel
  - pass the eventq index in the ioctl to avoid races
  - always wakeup on event?
  - wake up only one and have it wake up the right one ?
* progress thread sleeps on a special queue
  - some event wakeup both queues (force_wakeup)
  - other events wakeup the progress thread only no one on the regular queue

* truc messages
* rendez-vous messages
* notify messages
* connect messages
* retransmission

* omx_endpoint_info

* mapper (open-mxd)
* /dev/open-mxd ?

* use valgrind memory hooks
* add valgrind ioctl hooks

* no need to pad event to 64 ? no need to put the type at the end, but write it after the rest
* ntoh[sl] fields
* use kref to get user region without keeping a spinlock ?
* user region seqnum
* write parameter in ioctl to register a region, check it when reading/writing from/to the region
* keep a current (segment+offset+remaining) in user_region and recompute only when unordered
* use IOAT
* pass the user-address of contig small/tiny buffer instead of copying ?
* optimize shared comms between boards from within the driver

* add a VERSION file and a script to update MODULE_VERSION, COPYING and file headers ?

* non MXoE compatible extensions:
  + rdma in both direction with optional notification containing the target window id ?
  + no notify message, report event on rdma get completion ?
  + multiple segments in large messages
  + extend threshold for small/tiny ?
  + cleanup connect request/reply data
  + no bidirectionnal connect in the background
