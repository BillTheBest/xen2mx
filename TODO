* no need to pad cmd_hdr to 64 ?
* ntoh[sl] fields
* drop skb_linearize and support fragmented receive
* use kref to get user region without keeping a spinlock ?
* user region seqnum
* write parameter in ioctl to register a region, check it when reading/writing from/to the region
* keep a current (segment+offset+remaining) in user_region and recompute only when unordered
* use IOAT
* extend threshold for small/tiny ?
* pass the user-address of contig small/tiny buffer instead of copying ?
