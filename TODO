* true pull support
  - multiple frames per pull
  - multiple pull per request
  - actual data transfer with user region locking
* improve pull src_magic to hide things and keep the endpoint index extractable
* events for sending (needs a handle)
* no need to pad cmd_hdr to 64 ?
* ntoh[sl] fields
* use kref to get user region without keeping a spinlock ?
* user region seqnum
* write parameter in ioctl to register a region, check it when reading/writing from/to the region
* keep a current (segment+offset+remaining) in user_region and recompute only when unordered
* use IOAT
* pass the user-address of contig small/tiny buffer instead of copying ?
* optimize shared comms between boards from within the driver

* non MXoE compatible extensions:
  + rdma in both direction with optional notification containing the target window id ?
  + no notify message, report event on rdma get completion ?
  + multiple segments in large messages
  + extend threshold for small/tiny ?
