Open-MX 0.1.0 (December 20th 2007)
==================================
* First official release.
* API compatibility with MX 1.2 (almost complete).
* Wire compatibility with MX 1.2 (under development).
* Message retransmission.
* Support for kernel >= 2.6.17 (and some modified earlier kernels).

Caveats:
* Node disconnection not well recovered (some requests will remain
  uncompleted for ever)
* Large message retransmission seem to cause some kernel hang under
  heavy message loss rate.
* Blocking function will busy poll by default to avoid breaking
  retransmission and progression. Use OMX_WAITSPIN=1 to force
  sleeping.
* No background progression or retransmission is done if the
  application does not invoke an Open-MX routine explicitly.
