The Features release.

Major enhancements:
* Add vectorial communication support through omx_isendv, omx_issendv
  and omx_irecv.
* Add shared communication between endpoint on the same nodes, even if
  attached to different interfaces.
* Add safe partner disconnection detection and recovery.
* Enable sleeping function by default when using blocking calls since
  they now take care of waking up for progression if necessary.

Other improvements from previous release:

Caveats:
* No background progression or retransmission is done if the application does
  not invoke an Open-MX routine explicitly.

Open-MX 0.2.0 (January 16th 2008, svn r1072)
============================================
The Stabilizing-the-Basics release.

Major enhancements:
* Install a sbin/omx_local_install in the install directory to setup the
  /etc/init.d/open-mx startup script on each node, with the
  /etc/open-mx/open-mx.conf configuration file.
  The default static peers file is now /etc/open-mx/peers.
* Improved boards and peers management:
  + Add the omx_hostname tool to change board names.
  + Make omx_init_peers add a single peer when 2 arguments are given.
  + Merge peer and board names so that one updates to other one automatically.
* Rework large message support to handle abort, timeout, endpoint closing,
  interface removal, and early module removal safely.

Other improvements from previous release:
* Report interface removal to user-space.
* Add an ABI check between the driver and library.
* Fix possible pull handle confusion when an index is reused soon after.
* Fix driver build and ioctls on mixed 32/64bits platforms.
* Rework locking in the driver to reduce holding time and use RCU fast locking
  in the readers.
* Improve messages and debugging messages in the driver.
* Valgrind 3.3 support.
* Lots of various fixes.

Open-MX 0.1.0 (December 20th 2007, svn r908)
============================================
First official release.

Status:
* API compatibility with MX 1.2 (almost complete).
* Wire compatibility with MX 1.2 (still under development).
* Message retransmission.
* Support for kernel >= 2.6.15.

Other improvements from previous snapshot:
* Warn in user-space when opening an endpoint if its interface is not
  up or does not have a large enough MTU.
* Fix sequence number wrap-around all over the library code to handle
  long-term connections better.
* Ignore some packets instead of aborting in case of high-level of
  reordering on the network.
* Limit zombie send requests to 512 by default.
* Add various per-interface countersin the driver and the omx_counters
  tool to display/clear them.
* Make OMX_VERBOSE configurable to select which debug messages to show.

Caveats:
* Large message retransmission seem to cause some kernel hang under
  heavy message loss rate.





Open-MX alpha 2007-12-03 23:37 (svn r815)
=========================================
This release works well up-to 32kB but still has problems above. MPICH-MX
completes the full IMB benchmark suite if using less than 32kB max.

Changes:
* Add retransmission support
  + Using piggyack or delayed explicit acks in the lib
  + Using kernel timers for pull in the driver
  + All requests have a default timeout of 1000s
    - It may be configured with the new omx_set_request_timeout()
  + Add omx_forget() to avoid getting a completion event from a request
  + Allow buffered send to be completed before being acked, and OMX_ZOMBIE_SEND=0 to disable it
  + Add incomplete omx_disconnect() support
  + Add nacks on bad sessions, endpoints, or rdma windows
  + Add some module parameters to simulate packet loss
* Add support for communication to self
  + May be disabled with --disable-self or OMX_DISABLE_SELF=1
* Add sleeping support
  + Disabled for now unless OMX_WAITSPIN=0 is set since it prevents progression from happening
* Add timeout support for blocking functions in the API
* More MX API compat wrapper fixes to help mpich-mx work
* Add Linux 2.6.24 support
* Drop OMX_PEERS_FILENAME and add tools/omx_init_peers to load/clear the table
* Configuration enhancements
  + Add a trivial registration cache, disabled by default, enabled through OMX_RCACHE=1
  + Drop omx_ prefix from module parameters and add description for modinfo output
  + More options to omx_pingpong
* Miscellaneous optimizations
  + Reduce useless memsetting of request structure to 0
  + Do not post a pull request if length is 0
  + Add --disable-endian to reduce overhead on homogeneous architectures
* Debugging improvements
  + Add valgrind ioctl hooks
  + Only print verbose messages in the lib when --enable-debug is passed and OMX_VERBOSE is set
  + No debug messages by default in the driver
* Improve communication between the lib and the driver
  + Rework event reporting from the driver so that event queue full are easier to handle
  + Add shared mappings between the lib and driver to exchange various info instead of using ioctl
* Fix various memory leaks and minor bugs

Open-MX alpha 2007-10-01 10:53
==============================
Changes:
* Improve kernel module management
  + Add an omx_init script to start/stop
  + Create the /dev/open-mx with correct group and permissions in omx_init
    . Add --with-device to configure it
  + Fix the way we retrieve LINUX_RELEASE to support some non-vanilla kernels
    . Add --with-linux-release to override it
* Non MX-wire compatible improvements
  + Add --disable-mx-wire to disable native MX wire compatibility
  + Add --with-ethertype to change the Ethernet packet type
  + Send 31*8kB instead of 8*4kB in non-MX-wire compatible
  + Display several configuration options when loading the driver
* Large messages fixes
  + Fix pull seqnum wrap-around for very large messages
  + Fix RDMA id boundaries confusion between the lib and the driver
  + Complete the right large send when a notify arrives
* Event management improvements
  + Split event queue into expected and unexpected queues to avoid losing expected events in case of event queue full
  + Support queueing of medium send and large receive to manage the expected event queue properly
* Build improvements
  + Support overriding CC/AR/... on the configure or  make command line.
  + Support overriding the kernel module compiler with KCC
  + Fix configure.ac script for some strange autoconf version
* Lib improvements
  + Cleanup request state bitmask
  + Optimize the lib with likely/unlikely when built with GCC
  + Fix memory leak caused by requests never being freed
  + Add support for 0-segments in the MX API compat wrappers
* Change packet contents into network order to support multiple endian-different architectures
* Add minimal NACK support to detect wrong or closed endpoints on connect
* Make kernel debug messages runtime configurable through sysfs and only enable the important ones by default if --enable-debug was passed
* Add omx_endpoint_info
