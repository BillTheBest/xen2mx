$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

It build against the currently running kernel, using headers and build tree
in /lib/modules/`uname -r`/{source,build}.

To build for another kernel, use
$ ./configure --with-linux=/path/to/kernel/headers/
To build using another kernel build tree, use
$ ./configure --with-linux=/path/to/kernel/headers/ --with-linux-build=/path/to/kernel/build/tree/

You might experience some problems when running 'make install' as root
over NFS because some Makefiles might modify some files before actually
installing anything. To work this, assuming everything has been built
as non-root before, you may use
$ make installonly
so that it really only installs things without checking whether the build
is up-to-date.
