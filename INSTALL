| Basic Install |
+---------------+

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

By default, Open-MX will be installed in /opt/open-mx. Use --prefix on
the configure line to change this (or set prefix on the 'make install'
command line).

+---------------+
| Kernel Module |
+---------------+

Open-MX is composed of a user-space library with passes communication
commands to a kernel module. This module 'open-mx' will be installed
in the standard module path  /lib/modules/<kernel>/

During configure, Open-MX checks the running kernel with 'uname -r' and
builds the open-mx module against it, using its headers and build tree
in /lib/modules/`uname -r`/{source,build}.

To build for another kernel, use
$ ./configure --with-linux=/path/to/kernel/headers/
To build using another kernel build tree, use
$ ./configure --with-linux=/path/to/kernel/headers/ --with-linux-build=/path/to/kernel/build/tree/

| Caveats |
+---------+

1. Installing as root over NFS

Most NFS configurations do not allow root on the client to operate
as root on the server's files. When running 'make install' as root,
you might experience problems because some Makefiles (especially
the kernel driver's one) might modify some files before actually
installing anything.

To work around this, assuming everything has been built as non-root
before, you may use (as root)
$ make installonly
so that it really only installs things without checking whether the
build is up-to-date.
