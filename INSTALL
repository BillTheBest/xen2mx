| Basic Install |
+---------------+

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

By default, Open-MX will be installed in /opt/open-mx. Use --prefix on
the configure line to change this (or set prefix on the 'make install'
command line).

You might experience some problems when running 'make install' as root
over NFS because some Makefiles might modify some files before actually
installing anything. To work this, assuming everything has been built
as non-root before, you may use
$ make installonly
so that it really only installs things without checking whether the build
is up-to-date.

+---------------+
| Kernel Module |
+---------------+

Open-MX is composed of a user-space library with passes communication
commands to a kernel module. This module 'open-mx' will be installed
in the standard module path  /lib/modules/<kernel>/

During configure, Open-MX checks the running kernel with 'uname -r' and
builds the open-mx module against it, using its headers and build tree
in /lib/modules/`uname -r`/{source,build}.

To build for another kernel, use
$ ./configure --with-linux=/path/to/kernel/headers/
To build using another kernel build tree, use
$ ./configure --with-linux=/path/to/kernel/headers/ --with-linux-build=/path/to/kernel/build/tree/
