# Kbuild may fail during make install as a different user since it tries to create
# some files in .tmp_versions even when there is nothing to do. This is especially
# a problem when doing make install as root over NFS without root squash.
# Ignore these errors when the current user is not the one that ran configure.
# So make install as root does not fail, and we still do not ignore build failures
# as the normal user.
