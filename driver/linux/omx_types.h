/******************************
 * Notes about locking:
 *
 * The endpoint has 2 main status: FREE and OK. To prevent 2 people from changing it
 * at the same time, it is protected by a rwlock. To reduce the time we hold the lock,
 * there are 2 intermediate status: INITIALIZING and CLOSING.
 * When an endpoint is being used, its refcount is increased (by acquire/release)
 * When somebody wants to close an endpoint, it sets the CLOSING status (so that
 * new users can't acquire the endpoint), remove it from the interface, and the
 * the last user will release it for real.
 * The rwlock is taken as write only when opening and closing. Bottom halves are disabled
 * meanwhile since they might preempt the application. All other locks are taken as read,
 * especially on the receive side.
 *
 * The iface has both a kref to detect the last user and also has a number of endpoints 
 * attached to detect when we need to force.
 * There's a rwlock to protect this array against concurrent endpoint attach/detach.
 * When removing an iface (either by the user or by the netdevice notifier), the status
 * is set to CLOSING so that any new endpoint opener fails.
 * The rwlock is taken as write only when attach/detaching endpoints. Bottom halves are
 * disabled meanwhile since they might preempt the application. All other locks are taken
 * as read, especially on the receive side.
 *
 * When an iface is removed, all endpoints are scheduled for closing if necessary
 * (if forced) and the reference is released. The last endpoint will release the last
 * reference and thus release the device. When this happens because the unregister
 * notifier is called, the caller will wait for the last device reference to be released,
 * so we can return from the detach routine earlier as long as we guarantee that
 * things are being closed soon.
 *
 * The list of ifaces is always coherent since new ifaces are only added once initialized,
 * and removed in a coherent state (endpoints have been properly detached first)
 * Incoming packet processing is disabled while removing an iface.
 * So scanning the array of ifaces does not require locking,
 * but looking in the iface internals requires (read) locking.
 * The iface may not be removed while processing an incoming packet, so
 * we don't need locking and no need hold a reference on the iface either.
 * No need to disable bottom halves since it never scans the array of ifaces
 * (and the notifier callback may not be called from BH since it is interruptible).
 *
 * The locks are always taken in this priority order:
 * omx_iface_lock, iface->endpoint_lock, endpoint->lock
