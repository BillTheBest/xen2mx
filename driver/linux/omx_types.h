/******************************
 * Notes about locking:
 *
 * The endpoint has 2 main status: FREE and OK. To prevent 2 people from changing it
 * at the same time, it is protected by a lock. To reduce the time we hold the lock,
 * there are 2 intermediate status: INITIALIZING and CLOSING.
 * When an endpoint is being used, its refcount is increased (by acquire/release)
 * When somebody wants to close an endpoint, it sets the CLOSING status (so that
 * new users can't acquire the endpoint) and waits for current users to release
 * (when refcount becomes 0).
 *
 * The iface doesn't have an actual refcount since it has a number of endpoints attached.
 * There's a lock to protect this array against concurrent endpoint attach/detach.
 * When removing an iface (either by the user or by the netdevice notifier), the status
 * is set to CLOSING so that any new endpoint opener fails.
 *
 * The list of ifaces is always coherent since new ifaces are only added once initialized,
 * and removed in a coherent state (endpoints have been properly detached first)
 * Incoming packet processing is disabled while removing an iface.
 * So scanning the array of ifaces does not require locking,
 * but looking in the iface internals requires locking.
 * The iface may not be removed while processing an incoming packet, so
 * we don't need locking and no need hold a reference on the iface either.
 *
 * The locks are always taken in this priority order:
 * omx_iface_lock, iface->endpoint_lock, endpoint->lock
