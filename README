| Kernel Module |
+---------------+

The 'open-mx' kernel module should be loaded prior to any user-space
usage of Open-MX. If not loaded, a "No device" error will be returned.
$ modprobe open-mx

This module works at least on Linux kernels 2.6.17 to 2.6.23 on i386
and x86_64 architectures.

Once loaded, it creates a /dev/open-mx file which is used by user-space
libraries and programs. Write access to this file is required when using
Open-MX, so you might want to adjust your udev configuration to change
the default mode of this file, for instance by adding the following line
in a udev rules file:
KERNEL=="open-mx", MODE="0666", GROUP="users"

+----------------------+
| Attaching interfaces |
+----------------------+

By default, all existing network interfaces in the system will be
attached to Open-MX (except those above 8 by default). To change
the order or select which interfaces to attach, you may use the
omx_ifnames module parameter when loading:
$ modprobe open-mx omx_ifnames="eth3 eth2"

The current list of attached interfaces may be observed by reading
the /sys/class/misc/open-mx/ifaces special file. Writing '+foo' in
the file will attach interface 'foo'. Writing '-bar' will detach
interface 'bar'.

The interfaces may also be observed with the omx_info user-space
tool.

+-----------------+
| Peer Table File |
+-----------------+

A file listing peers must be provided, either in the current directory,
or at a location given in the environment variable OMX_PEERS_FILENAME
or with the --with-peers-file=<path> configure option.
The contents of the file is one line per peer, each containing
3 tabulation-separated fields:
* a unique peer index
* a mac address (6 colon-separated numbers)
* a board name (<hostname>.<ifacename>)
